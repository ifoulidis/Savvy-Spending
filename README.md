# Savvy-Spending


Here we have it! A success!

It's still basic, but it's already quite late, so I must resist the urge to do more.

The next thing to do is make the title, background color, and text color editable from the modal page.

I will also add a logo up the top. I told Amos I'd pay him to draw one.
